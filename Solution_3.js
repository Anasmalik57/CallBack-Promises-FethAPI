/* Write a function that takes in an array of integers and a callback function, and returns a new array where each Write a JavaScript function called ageInDays that accepts an object containing a person's first name, last name, and age in years as input. The function should concatenate the first and last name into a single string and store it in a variable called fullName. It should then calculate the person's age in days and store it in a variable called ageInDays.The ageInDays function should then return a callback function that logs a message to the console. The message should include the person's full name and age in days, and should be in the format: "The person's full name is [full name] and their age in days is [age in days]." Note that the ageInDays function should not log the message to the console directly, but should instead return a callback function that can be used to log the message at a later time. */
